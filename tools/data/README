This directory contains data needed by Bison.

* Skeletons
Bison skeletons: the general shapes of the different parser kinds,
that are specialized for specific grammars by the bison program.

Currently, the supported skeletons are:

- yacc.c
  It used to be named bison.simple: it corresponds to C Yacc
  compatible LALR(1) parsers.

- lalr1.cc
  Produces a C++ parser class.

- lalr1.java
  Produces a Java parser class.

- glr.c
  A Generalized LR C parser based on Bison's LALR(1) tables.

- glr.cc
  A Generalized LR C++ parser.  Actually a C++ wrapper around glr.c.

These skeletons are the only ones supported by the Bison team.
Because the interface between skeletons and the bison program is not
finished, *we are not bound to it*.  In particular, Bison is not
mature enough for us to consider that ``foreign skeletons'' are
supported.

* m4sugar
This directory contains M4sugar, sort of an extended library for M4,
which is used by Bison to instantiate the skeletons.

* xslt
This directory contains XSLT programs that transform Bison's XML output
into various formats.

- bison.xsl
  A library of routines used by the other XSLT programs.

- xml2dot.xsl
  Conversion into GraphViz's dot format.

- xml2text.xsl
  Conversion into text.

- xml2xhtml.xsl
  Conversion into XHTML.
